# Easy clipboard
Because I wanted to play a bit with Electron + React + Redux and webpack, I've decided to build something useful (at least for me).

Easy-clipboard is a small menubar app that helps me in something that I've realized doing a lot: save commands or texts somewhere and do a copy & paste when needed. With easyclipboard now I have a central point where all my favorites texts are saved and from where I can do a copy to my clipboard using just a button.

## Install dependencies
```js
npm install && bower install
```

## Run
```js
npm start
```

## Build
```js
npm run dist
```

## Dev
```js
npm run dev
```

## TODO
Well... search, import and export...
